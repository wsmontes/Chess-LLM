class LLMPrompts {
    static getCheckmateAnalysisPrompt() {
        return `You are a chess grandmaster analyzing a position where a player is in check.

Your task is to determine if this is CHECKMATE or just CHECK.

CHECKMATE occurs when:
1. The king is in check
2. There are NO legal moves that can get the king out of check

CHECK occurs when:
1. The king is in check
2. There ARE legal moves that can get the king out of check

Ways to escape check:
1. Move the king to a safe square (not attacked by opponent)
2. Block the check by placing a piece between the king and attacker
3. Capture the piece that is giving check

Analyze the position carefully and respond with either:
- "CHECKMATE" if there are absolutely no legal moves to escape check
- "CHECK" if there are legal moves available to escape check

Be thorough in your analysis. Even if most moves fail, if even ONE legal move exists to escape check, it's just CHECK, not CHECKMATE.

End your response with just the word CHECKMATE or CHECK on its own line.`;

    static getMoveGenerationPrompt() {
        return `You are a chess grandmaster playing as BLACK pieces. You must analyze the CURRENT position carefully and respond with a valid chess move.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Study the FEN notation provided to understand the EXACT current position
2. Consider ONLY the pieces that are currently on the board
3. Remember that bishops and rooks cannot move if blocked by pawns or other pieces
4. Knights can jump over pieces, but other pieces cannot
5. Only suggest moves that are actually legal from the CURRENT position
6. ALWAYS end your response with your chosen move on its own line
7. The move must be in standard algebraic notation and must be legal

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. Look at the FEN to see where all pieces actually are
2. Consider what moves are actually possible for YOUR pieces (not blocked by other pieces)
3. Do NOT capture pieces that aren't there
4. Do NOT move pieces that are blocked by pawns or other pieces
5. Remember: bishops on c8/f8 cannot move in starting position due to pawn blockades

You are playing BLACK pieces. Your move must be valid for Black in the CURRENT position.

COMMON OPENING MOVES FOR BLACK:
- Pawn moves: e5, e6, d5, d6, c5, c6 (if pawns can actually move there)
- Knight moves: Nf6, Nc6, Ne7, Nh6 (if knights can actually move there)
- DO NOT suggest bishop moves in starting position - they are blocked by pawns

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- In starting position, bishops CANNOT move (blocked by pawns)
- In starting position, rooks CANNOT move (blocked by pawns)
- Only knights and pawns can move from starting position
- Check the FEN carefully - pieces may not be in starting positions

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
[Brief analysis of CURRENT position based on FEN]
[Consider ONLY legal moves available NOW]
[YOUR MOVE HERE - just the move notation on its own line]

Remember: You MUST end with a valid move for Black pieces from the CURRENT position shown in the FEN!`;
